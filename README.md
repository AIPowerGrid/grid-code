- **üö® Incident Response** - Rapid troubleshooting and resolution workflows
- **üìä Infrastructure Monitoring** - Performance analysis and capacity planning

## üí° Free Options Available

Get started with RAS CLI at no cost using any of these free options:

### üî• Qwen OAuth (Recommended)

- **2,000 requests per day** with no token limits
- **60 requests per minute** rate limit
- Simply run `ras` and authenticate with your qwen.ai account
- Automatic credential management and refresh
- Use `/auth` command to switch to Qwen OAuth if you have initialized with OpenAI compatible mode

### üåè Regional Free Tiers

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Node.js version 20](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or higher installed.

```bash
curl -qL https://www.npmjs.com/install.sh | sh
```

### Install from npm

```bash
npm install -g @ras-ai/ras-cli@latest
ras --version
```

### Install from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code.git
cd qwen-code
npm install
npm install -g .
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start RAS CLI
ras

# NOC-specific examples
> Analyze this Linux server's performance metrics
> Help me troubleshoot this Cisco switch connectivity issue
> Generate a VMware VM migration script
> Check storage capacity and performance on this SAN
> Create an incident response playbook for network outages
```

### Session Management

Control your token usage with configurable session limits to optimize costs and performance.

#### Configure Session Token Limit

Create or edit `.ras/settings.json` in your home directory:

```json
{
  "sessionTokenLimit": 32000,
  "nocSpecialization": true,
  "defaultContext": "infrastructure"
}
```

#### Session Commands

- **`/compress`** - Compress conversation history to continue within token limits
- **`/clear`** - Clear all conversation history and start fresh
- **`/stats`** - Check current token usage and limits
- **`/noc`** - Switch to NOC-specific context and prompts

> üìù **Note**: Session token limit applies to a single conversation, not cumulative API calls.

### Authorization

Choose your preferred authentication method based on your needs:

#### 1. Qwen OAuth (üöÄ Recommended - Start in 30 seconds)

The easiest way to get started - completely free with generous quotas:

```bash
# Just run this command and follow the browser authentication
ras
```

**What happens:**

1. **Instant Setup**: CLI opens your browser automatically
2. **One-Click Login**: Authenticate with your qwen.ai account
3. **Automatic Management**: Credentials cached locally for future use
4. **NOC Optimization**: Pre-configured for infrastructure management tasks

**Free Tier Benefits:**

- ‚úÖ **2,000 requests/day** (no token counting needed)
- ‚úÖ **60 requests/minute** rate limit
- ‚úÖ **Automatic credential refresh**
- ‚úÖ **Zero cost** for individual users
- ‚úÖ **NOC-specialized responses**
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note**: Model fallback may occur to maintain service quality

#### 2. OpenAI-Compatible API

Use API keys for OpenAI or other compatible providers:

**Configuration Methods:**

1. **Environment Variables**

   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
   export OPENAI_BASE_URL="your_api_endpoint"
   export OPENAI_MODEL="your_model_choice"
   ```

2. **Project `.env` File**
   Create a `.env` file in your project root:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   OPENAI_BASE_URL=your_api_endpoint
   OPENAI_MODEL=your_model_choice
   ```
